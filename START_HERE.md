# ✅ CollegeConnect is Ready to Run!

## 🎉 Setup Complete

I've set up everything you need to run CollegeConnect locally. The backend has been built successfully!

## 🚀 How to Run (EASIEST METHOD)

Open **3 separate terminals** and run these commands:

### Terminal 1 - Firestore Emulator
```bash
cd /home/gb/Desktop/NAVEventProject/CollegeConnect
./run-emulator.sh
```
Wait until you see: "Dev App Server is now running"

### Terminal 2 - Backend API  
```bash
cd /home/gb/Desktop/NAVEventProject/CollegeConnect
./run-backend.sh
```
Wait until you see: "Started Application"

### Terminal 3 - Frontend
```bash
cd /home/gb/Desktop/NAVEventProject/CollegeConnect
./run-frontend.sh
```
Wait until you see: "Ready in..."

## 🌐 Access the Application

Once all three services are running, open your browser to:

**http://localhost:9002**

You'll be redirected to the login page where you can choose a test user.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Services won't start?
1. Make sure no other services are using ports 8080, 8081, or 9002
2. Check for errors in the terminal output
3. Refer to `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` for detailed troubleshooting

### Can't access the frontend?
