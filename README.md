# 🎓 CollegeConnect

A modern campus event management platform built with Next.js, Spring Boot, and Firebase.

## 🌟 Features

- **Event Discovery**: Browse all campus events with interactive map visualization
- **Role-Based Access**: Presidents can create/manage events, students can view and navigate
- **Advanced Navigation**: 
  - **Bidirectional A* Algorithm**: Fast pathfinding using BiA* (Faster Than Dijkstra)
  - **Smart Snapping**: Automatic adjustment to nearest roads when routing fails
  - **Graph Stitching**: 3280-edge optimized graph with intelligent road network bridging
  - **Visual Feedback**: Dashed lines showing where clicks were snapped to roads
  - **Interactive Map**: Click anywhere to set custom start points for navigation
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure anonymous login with role-based profiles
- **Responsive Design**: Built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

## 🎯 Key API Endpoints

### Events
- `GET /api/events` - List all events
- `GET /api/events/{id}` - Get event details
- `POST /api/events` - Create event (presidents only)

### Users
- `GET /api/users/{uid}` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/{uid}` - Update user profile

### Navigation
- `GET /api/navigation/bounds` - Get campus boundary coordinates
- `POST /api/navigation/route` - Calculate route with smart snapping
  - Uses BiA* algorithm by default
  - Automatically snaps to nearest roads if routing fails
  - Returns path coordinates and snap segment data
- `POST /api/navigation/compare` - Compare A* vs BiA* performance

## �️ Navigation System Architecture

### Graph Construction
The navigation system uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to build a campus road network:

1. **OSM Parsing**: Extracts nodes and walkable ways from `map.osm`
2. **Graph Building**: Creates bidirectional edges between connected nodes
3. **Graph Stitching** (Critical for connectivity):
   - **Endpoint Stitching**: Bridges way endpoints within 50m (adds ~134 connections)
   - **Isolated Node Stitching**: Connects weakly-connected nodes (adds ~776 connections)
   - **Result**: 1803 nodes, 3280 edges (vs 864 without stitching)

### Pathfinding Algorithms

#### Bidirectional A* (BiA*) - Default
- Searches from both start and end simultaneously
- Typically 1.5-3x faster than standard A*
- Uses haversine distance as heuristic
- Stops when search frontiers meet

#### Standard A* - Available for Comparison
- Single-direction search from start to goal
- Kept for performance benchmarking
- Access via `/compare` endpoint

### Smart Snapping Feature
When direct routing fails (user clicks off-road):

1. **First Attempt**: Try direct routing with clicked coordinates
2. **Snap & Retry**: If fails, snap both start and end to nearest graph nodes
3. **Visualization**: Show dashed gray lines indicating adjustments
4. **User Feedback**: Toast notification shows when snapping occurred

### Performance Metrics
- Average routing time: 1-5ms for typical campus routes
- Graph load time: ~200ms on startup
- Memory footprint: ~15MB for full campus graph
